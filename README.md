# MDX	Deck with Greensock

Combining my favorite new React presentation deck awesome sauce ([MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck)) with my favorite old do-anything-you-can-imagine animation platform ([Greensock](https://greensock.com)).

This is a demo that takes the [MDX Deck Demo](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck/blob/master/docs/demo.mdx) by [Prolific AF Jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/), a [hook](https://github.com/johnlindquist/use-gsap) that the great [John Lindquist](https://johnlindquist.com/) put together in probably 2 seconds and some ideas from my old [TweenDeck lib](https://johnpolacek.github.io/tweendeck/).

This is still a work-in-progress and Iâ€™m still trying to figure out how to work with it to be honest. Like, hey make sure you keep those extra linebreaks in there or you will have a bad time, plus assorted other oddness. Still, it feels like I might be on to something here!
