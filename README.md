# MDX	Deck with Greensock

I am messing around combining my favorite new React presentation deck awesome sauce ([MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck)) with my favorite old do-anything-you-can-imagine animation platform ([Greensock](https://greensock.com)).

I basically took the [MDX Deck Demo](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck/blob/master/docs/demo.mdx) by [Prolific AF Jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/), a [hook](https://github.com/johnlindquist/use-gsap) that the great [John Lindquist](https://johnlindquist.com/) put together in probably 2 seconds and some ideas from my old [TweenDeck lib](https://johnpolacek.github.io/tweendeck/), and got this lil’ diddy. Like to hear it? It goes like this...

Things are a little weird and I’m still trying to figure out how to work with it to be honest. Like, hey make sure you keep those extra linebreaks in there or you will have a bad time, plus assorted other oddness. Still, it feels like I might be on to something here! Or not, we’re having fun over here. By we, I mean me and my computer.
