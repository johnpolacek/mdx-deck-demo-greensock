# MDX	Deck with Greensock

Combining my favorite new React presentation deck awesome sauce ([MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck)) with my favorite old do-anything-you-can-imagine animation platform ([Greensock](https://greensock.com)).

This is a demo that takes the [MDX Deck Demo](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck/blob/master/docs/demo.mdx) by [Prolific AF Jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/), a [hook](https://github.com/johnlindquist/use-gsap) that the great [John Lindquist](https://johnlindquist.com/) put together in probably 2 seconds and some ideas from my old [TweenDeck lib](https://johnpolacek.github.io/tweendeck/).

This is still a work-in-progress and Iâ€™m still trying to figure out how to work with it to be honest. Like, hey make sure you keep those extra linebreaks in there or you will have a bad time, plus assorted other oddness. Still, it feels like I might be on to something here!

## Getting Started

Download or clone the repo and then install the dependencies as per the usual.

~~~~
npm install
~~~~

The animation source files can be found in the `animation` directory.

Most animations will apply an animation (aka a Tween) to a div wrapper courtesy of a `useTweenLite` hook (for TweenMax, change it to `useTweenMax`. To avoid a flash of un-animated content, we set initial opacity to 0 then update it via Tween.

Because the animations use `TweenLite.to()` (see [Greensock docs](https://greensock.com/docs/TweenLite/static.to())), we use `startAt` to set the initial state of the properties to be animated.

*animation/Bounce.js*

~~~~
import React from 'react'
import useTweenLite from './useTweenLite'
import { Bounce } from 'gsap'


export default props => {

  const [tweenRef] = useTweenLite(props.duration || 1, {startAt:{ y: props.y || -200, x: props.x || 0}, opacity: 1, x:0 , y:0, ease:Bounce.easeOut, delay: props.delay || 0 })
  
  return (
    <div style={{opacity:0}} ref={tweenRef} {...props} />
  )
}
~~~~

We can also animate individual child elements in MDX, such as a list.
